\bluebox{Solving inverse problems}
{
Given the observation $\yb$ and a linear forward model $G$, we infer for parameter $\ub$ by solving

\[\ub^* = \min_{\ub} \,
\half \nor{G\ub - \yb}_{\ycovinv}^2\]

However, the inverse problem is usually ill-posed including instability, non-uniqueness, non-existence. A widely-used remedy is to regularize the parameter by a prior term, e.g., Tikhonov regularization framework, as following 

\[\ub^* = \min_{\ub} \, \half \nor{G\ub - \yb}_{\ycovinv}^2  + \halfv{\lambda} \nor{\ub}_{\ucovinv}^2 \]

\myred{The key issue: we essentially regularize the whole parameter space.} Ideally, only unimportant subspace, which causes instability, should be regularized.
