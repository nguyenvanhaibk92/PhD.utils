\bluebox{Common machine learning approaches for solving PDEs}
{    

\begin{itemize}
\item PINN [\myblue{Raissi M., 2019}]: solving for a case of dynamical
\item Transformer [\myblue{Li Zijie, 2024}], Graph neural network [\myblue{Iakovlev, V. 2020}]: capturing spatial/temporal correlations at once directly mapping from $T_i$ to $T_{i+1}$
\item Operator learning: FNO [\myblue{Li Z., 2020}], DeepONet [\myblue{Lu Lu, 2019}] directly mapping solutions from $T_0$ to $T_{end}$
\item Neural ODE [\myblue{Chen, R. T., 2018}]/Recurrent neural network [\myblue{Mohajerin, N. 2019}] (most related to our work) learning right hand side (tangent slope/dynamical evolution) of dynamical systems, temporal correlation is taken into consideration by time integration scheme.

\end{itemize}

\orangebox{Limitations}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inference stability, long-term prediction capacity due to inference error accumulation.
        \item Generalization to different scenarios (boundary conditions, geometry, invariant-discretization, ...)
        \item Discontinuities/shocks evolution (limited research)
    \end{itemize}
