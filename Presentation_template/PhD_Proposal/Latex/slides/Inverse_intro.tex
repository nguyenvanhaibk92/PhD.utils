{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{TNet} [\myblue{3}] - A model-constrained deep learning approach for solving inverse problems.
    \item \texttt{TAEN} [\myblue{4}] - A model-constrained Tikhonov autoencoder network for solving both forward and inverse problems. This is a significant improvement from \texttt{TNet} [\myblue{3}].
\end{itemize}
