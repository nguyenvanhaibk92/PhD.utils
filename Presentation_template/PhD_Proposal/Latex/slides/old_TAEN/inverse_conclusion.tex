\bluebox{\TNetAE{} (under review)}
{
\begin{itemize}
    \item is able to learn forward and inverse maps with only 1 observation sample
    \item is robust to a wide range of data randomization noise level
    \item is robust to an arbitrarily chosen observation sample
    \item provides real-time solvers
\end{itemize}
Drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item has expensive training cost due to differentiable PDE solvers
    \item is not helpful for rich data scenarios
\end{itemize}
}

\bluebox{Future work}
{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Relax the requirement for differentiable solvers
        \item Extend to large-scale problems
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
