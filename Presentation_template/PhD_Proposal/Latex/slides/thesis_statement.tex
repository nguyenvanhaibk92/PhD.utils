{    
\begin{itemize}
    \item I developed model-constrained machine learning approaches trained with {\bf limited data} for solving forward problems [\myblue{1},\myblue{2}] and inverse problems [\myblue{3},\myblue{4},\myblue{5}] {\bf faster and use less memory, while being as accurate as,} the conventional numerical methods.
    \item I proposed a data-informed active subspace framework [{\myblue{6}}] and a unified randomization
    method framework [{\myblue{7}}] for solving inverse problems {\bf more accurately and efficiently}.
\end{itemize}
